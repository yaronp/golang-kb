## Testing

* [Ginkgo](http://github.com/onsi/ginkgo): a BDD Testing Framework for Golang
* [Gomega](http://github.com/onsi/gomega) is a matcher/assertion library
* [Agouti](https://agouti.org/) is an universal WebDriver client for Go. For acceptance or integration testing, it is best complemented by the Ginkgo BDD testing framework and Gomega matcher library, but it is designed to be both testing-framework- and matcher-library-agnostic.
